This fork is intended to make it easy to install under Ubuntu
The original source is at https://code.launchpad.net/enso but it haven't been updated for months
The enso group is now flooded with spam message, so I decided to keep my own work instead

Issues: 
The set_selection method for commands is not working


Todo:
Find a good open command with learn and unlearn
Create a map command
Make banshee, tomboy and other commands default (or easy to find)
Look on branches and try to find the final implementation of URL based installation of commands (it's not working on my version)
Make .ensocommands a directory (or a helper) instead of a full file of commands
